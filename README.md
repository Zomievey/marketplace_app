Create a web application that displays a list of products. The application should allow users to filter the products by category and sort them by price or name.
Instructions:
* 		The product data should be fetched from a JSON file.
* 		Each product should have a name, price, image, and category.
* 		The application should display the products in a grid format, with each product displaying its name, price, and image.
* 		The application should have a sidebar with a select field for filtering by category, and radio buttons for sorting by price or name.
* 		The sidebar should allow users to select multiple categories for filtering.
* 		The sorting should be dynamic and update the product list without requiring a page refresh.
Deliverables:
* 		Share the code through a Github repository
* 		Provide a link to a live demo of the application
Bonus:
* 		Add an option to add a product to a cart
* 		Show the total number of items in the cart
Note:
* 		The design and layout of the application is not important, focus on the functionality.
* 		The use of any front-end framework such as React or Vue is allowed.
* 		The application should be responsive and work on different screen sizes.
